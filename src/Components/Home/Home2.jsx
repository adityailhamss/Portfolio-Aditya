            Hello, my name is Aditya Ilham Subagja. I am a recent graduate from the Informatics Engineering Department at Universitas Komputer Indonesia. During my time at university, I developed a strong foundation in web development, gaining proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Java.
            In addition to my academic achievements, I have practical experience from a three-month internship as a Front-End Developer at a startup company in Bandung. During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on multiple projects, successfully developing and deploying websites into production.
            My passion for web development is reflected in the various web projects I've created, including e-commerce sites like Furniro for a furniture shop, Donatsu for a donut shop, DesignXX for design services, and Smarthomes for electronics sales. I am also skilled in technical writing, having created several technical documents and user guides.
            I am eager to bring my knowledge, skills, and enthusiasm for web development to a dynamic team where I can continue to grow and contribute effectively.
            Thank you for your consideration.
